# Anagrams
# asks the user for two separate texts;
# checks whether, the entered texts are anagrams and prints the result.
# Note:
# assume that two empty strings are not anagrams;
# treat upper- and lower-case letters as equal;
# spaces are not taken into account during the check â€“ treat them as non-existent
